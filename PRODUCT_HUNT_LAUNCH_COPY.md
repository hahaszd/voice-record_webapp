You're watching a YouTube video. A brilliant insight appears. You pause, open a note app, start typing… and by then, the moment is gone. The video lost its flow. Your thought lost its clarity.

2. Choose your recording window (30s / 1m / 5m)
3. Click start, then forget about it
4. When inspiration strikes → just speak
5. Click transcribe → AI converts your voice to text
6. Auto-copied to clipboard, ready to paste anywhere

## 💬 First Comment (Maker's Comment)

### Template 1: Story-Driven（推荐）

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], maker of VoiceSpark.

**The Origin Story:**
I was watching a coding tutorial on YouTube when the instructor said something mind-blowing. I paused the video, opened my notes app, started typing… and by the time I got back, I'd completely lost the context. Worse — I couldn't even remember what I wanted to write.

That moment haunted me. How many brilliant ideas have I lost because I couldn't capture them fast enough?

**That's why I built VoiceSpark.**

The core insight: Most voice recorders make you "get ready" before speaking. Click the app. Find the button. Press record. By then, the thought is already fading.

VoiceSpark is different. You open it once at the start of your day, then forget it exists. It's always listening in the background. When inspiration strikes — you just speak. No prep. No friction. Your thoughts are already captured.

**What makes it unique:**
• Always-on recording (open once, capture all day)
• Works while you're watching videos/listening to podcasts
• System audio capture (record from any browser tab)
• AI transcription in seconds
• Auto-copy to clipboard
• 100% local storage (nothing uploaded)
• No registration required

**Perfect for:**
- Students taking notes during lectures
- Writers gathering inspiration
- Developers logging debugging insights
- Content creators researching ideas
- Anyone who's thought "I should write this down" and then forgot

**Why no registration?**
I wanted zero friction. You should be able to try it in 10 seconds, not 10 minutes. If you like it, bookmark it. That's all you need.

**What I'm working on next:**
- Mobile app (Capacitor-based)
- More transcription languages
- Cloud sync (optional, for those who want it)

**I'd love to hear:**
- What's YOUR biggest idea-capture pain point?
- Would you use this for your workflow?
- What feature would make this perfect for you?

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀

P.S. The app is completely free right now. I'm still figuring out the business model, but early users will get grandfathered into any paid features.

Try it: voicespark.app
```

### Template 2: Problem-Solution Format

```
Hey PH! 👋

Quick question: How many brilliant ideas have you lost because you couldn't hit "record" fast enough?

I've built VoiceSpark to solve exactly that problem.

**The Problem:**
Traditional voice recorders require you to:
1. Open the app ❌
2. Find the record button ❌
3. Click it ❌
4. Start speaking ✅

By step 4, your thought is already fading.

**The VoiceSpark Way:**
1. Open once (at start of day) ✅
2. Speak whenever ✅

That's it. It's always listening in the background. Zero prep time. Zero friction.

**Core Innovation:**
"Always-On Recording" — like having a voice recorder that never turns off. Perfect for:
- 🎬 Watching YouTube videos (capture insights without pausing)
- 🎙️ Listening to podcasts (save quotes instantly)
- 💭 Random shower thoughts (speak before they vanish)

**Features:**
• AI transcription (voice → text in seconds)
• System audio recording (capture from any browser tab)
• Auto-copy to clipboard
• Local storage (100% private)
• No registration needed

**Try it:** voicespark.app (works instantly, no sign-up)

**Feedback wanted:**
- Does this solve a real problem for you?
- What use case would you use it for?
- What's missing?

Thanks for your support! 🙏

## 🎤 Responses to Common Questions

### "Why not just use my phone's voice recorder?"
```
Great question! Phone recorders require you to:
1. Unlock phone
2. Open app
3. Click record
4. Start speaking

By then, you've lost 10-15 seconds and potentially your train of thought.

VoiceSpark runs in your browser, already open, always listening. The moment you think of something → just speak. Zero friction.

Plus, VoiceSpark can record system audio (YouTube, podcasts, etc.), which phone recorders can't do.
```

### "Is this safe? What about privacy?"
```
100% safe and private:
- All data stored LOCALLY in your browser
- Nothing uploaded to any server
- No account = no data collection
- You can clear history anytime

Think of it like using a notepad app — everything stays on your device.
```

### "How is this different from Otter.ai / Rev / etc?"
```
Great tools, but they focus on long-form transcription (meetings, interviews).

VoiceSpark is designed for quick idea capture:
- Always-on recording (they require you to start/stop)
- No registration needed (they require accounts)
- Optimized for short bursts (30s-5m, not 1-hour meetings)
- System audio capture (record from YouTube, podcasts)

Think: Quick notes vs. full meeting transcripts.
```

### "Will this work on mobile?"
```
The web version works on mobile browsers (microphone only).

I'm working on a native mobile app (Capacitor-based) for better background recording. Coming soon!

Desktop is currently the best experience because you get:
- System audio capture
- Dual recording (mic + system)
- More stable background recording
```

### "What's your business model?"
```
Still figuring it out! Options I'm considering:
1. Freemium (free basic, paid for longer durations/cloud sync)
2. One-time payment
3. Keep it free, monetize through other products

Early users will be grandfathered into any paid features as a thank-you for early support. 🙏
```
