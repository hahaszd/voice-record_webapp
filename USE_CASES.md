## 📚 Learning & Education

### **Use Case 1: YouTube Tutorial Notes**

**Scenario**: Sarah is learning React.js from YouTube tutorials

## 💻 Professional Work

### **Use Case 9: Meeting One-Liners**

**Scenario**: Lisa attends video meetings but doesn't need full transcripts

**Her hack**:
```
During Zoom call:
- Keeps Spark Capture ready
- When client says something important:

  → Client: "Budget is $50k, deadline March 15"
  → Instantly transcribed

After meeting:
→ Has 5-10 key snippets

    add code SAVE10, total stays same."

3. Transcript becomes instant bug report
4. Pastes into Jira

 Wait, what if I combined A and B?
 Actually, the real issue is Y, not X.
 Let me think about solving Y instead..."

[Captures 5-minute thinking session]

→ Add to task manager
→ Nothing forgotten
```

**Why not just use task manager?**: Faster to speak than to type on phone or switch apps
